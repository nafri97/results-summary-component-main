## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned
 this code I learn pretty much, such as : responsiveness, gradient background, box-shadow, etc.

```css
  @media screen and (max-width:600px) {
}
``` ^^this code used for in resolution <=600 will appplied.
```css
  background: linear-gradient(to bottom, hsl(252, 100%, 67%) 20%,hsl(241, 81%, 54%) 80%);
```^^this code is used to made gradient background between 20%-80% with selected hsl color.
```css
  box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px rgba(12, 5, 29, 0.2);
```^^this code is used for add box shadow  '5px' xy offset shadow, '10px' radius of shadow, and dark purple color with '0.2' opacity.

### Continued development
  this code I wasn't know how to using .js or .json so in the future i will learn them after I mastered enough using css.
